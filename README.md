# AI-vs.-Human-Creativity-Developing-a-Detection-Application-for-AI-Generated-Art

This repository contains the experiment code for our research project on distinguishing AI-generated art from human-created artwork. We evaluated three deep learning models — CNN, Vision Transformer (ViT), and VGG16 — using the CIFAKE dataset to classify images. The best-performing model (VGG16) was deployed using Gradio for real-time classification.

Features:

- Image classification models (CNN, ViT, VGG16)

- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

- Interactive Gradio interface for AI-art detection

Note: This repo includes only the code used for experimentation and deployment, not the full report.
The file table.md contains the experiment results, while the file Experiment_Results.csv contains our experiment
